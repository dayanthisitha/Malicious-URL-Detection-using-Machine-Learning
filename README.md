#About Data

For training and testing machine learning algorithms, we have used a huge dataset of 651,191 URLs, out of which 428103 benign or safe URLs, 96457 defacement URLs, 94111 phishing URLs, and 32520 malware URLs. Figure 2 depicts their distribution in terms of percentage. As we know one of the most crucial tasks is to curate the dataset for a machine learning project. We have curated this dataset from five different sources.
